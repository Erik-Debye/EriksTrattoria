Final Project for Web250 (Server-side Scripting) - A work in progress

A simple pizza ordering site created with MongoDB, ExpressJS, HTML5, CSS3, and ES6+ JS. Includes session-based authentication, new user registration, and more.

Note: This is a work in progress, with a goal completion date in Mid to Late May 2023. Responsiveness to mobile devices currently not guaranteed.

If you see additional issues either on your local build or the live site, please let me know!
